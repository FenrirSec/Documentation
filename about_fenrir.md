# What we do (in the shadows)?

Fenrir.pro has been created in 2023 (as a company) but was more of a "brand" name before, with my auto-entreprise running behind.

As of today (26/03/2024), fenrir.pro has 2 main activities :

- PenTest
- Training

And other secondary activities, including content creation and marketing.

## Pentest

Penetration testing missions for small to bigger companies, often but not only in the medical field.

Mostly remote GNU/Linux (sometimes Windows) infrastructures, from 1 server to hundreds of machines.

They usually last about 4 days and we try to do at least 1/month, it's sometimes more, sometimes less depending on the year.

We sometimes do incident response, but it's not one of our main activities and we might stop doing it someday.

## Training

Hosting in-house training sessions was one of the reasons of the creation of fenrir.pro (the company), I've been designing a few training sessions since then and creating online content.

Training sessions are done on site as of today, at the client's location.

I'd like to have them available online someday.

## Content creation

We create two types of contents

- Paid Content
  - Training Material for in-house sessions
  - Labs
- Free Content
  - Articles
  - Youtube Videos
  - Hack.courses
  - Labs

## Marketing

Finally, as a company, fenrir.pro needs to get new clients and we do so by doing marketing. Mainly content marketing (included in our free content, youtube videos, articles etc).

Given the size of the company, and the fact that no one is dedicated to this part, everyone needs to be involved in our marketing actions for the moment. It includes LinkedIn posts, articles, vulnerability research and sometimes reaching out to clients. 

## Other Projects

Alongside those tasks, we also develop projects, which requires people with development skills :

- Honeypot
- Vulpes
- hack.courses
- feed.fenrir.pro

## Objectives

- Provide financial stability for as many employees as possible
- Be viable without relying on investors
- Train more people // Audit more companies
- Stay an affordable and qualitative penetration testing provider

---

## Projects

- Twitch Lives
- More Youtube
- Newsletter ?
- Talks
- Remake the website to more clearly

---

## Core Values

- People's Autonomy
- Value of everyone's free time (no overtime unless a client pays for it)
- Flexibility (do not have defined work times as long as objectives are done and everyone can communicate)
- Keep the Hackers values alive
  - Sharing of knowledge (We open source what we can, take some time to teach each other, avoid secrets)
  - Openness (Respect and accept others and their experiences, IT was at a time a safe place for weirdos and outcasts of all kind and it should stay that way)
  - World improvement (Overall we aim to make things better, if there is an eco-thougtful solution, prefer this one, if we can work for more ethical companies, even for less money, we'll do it)

## Work Management

It's in constant evolution, I'm thinking about doing 4 days // 8 hours (32 hours) work weeks, (for instance someone could do 09:30 to 13:00 and 14:00 to 18:30).

We're doing a stand-up in the morning, each day if possible, given the remote aspect of our organisation.

We have daily tasks and weekly tasks (separated in daily tasks eventually)

Daily tasks are small tasks like :

- Write a linkedin post
- Send a message to a client
- Schedule or participate to a meeting with a client

Weekly tasks are trello cards, with each their own duration. Decided/Estimated at the start of the project by the team.

Once these are done, the only internal meetings we have are follow-ups of long projets requiring specific communication and onboarding for new projects.

Obviously if someone needs help with something, I can jump into a call, but we try to keep mandatory communication low for everyone to have a flexible schedule.

## What we look for the people we work with?

- Desire to participate in fenrir.pro's growth
- Abilities for remote work, autonomy and knowing when to ask for help when stuck on something
- Desire to share what they know with others
