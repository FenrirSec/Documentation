# Fenrir Pentest Methodology


## The 6 Phases

- Pre-engagement
- Intelligence Gathering (Reconnaissance)
<!-- - Threat Modeling (Assessment) ? -->
- Vulnerability Analysis
- Exploitation
- Post Exploitation
- Reporting

---


## Pre Engagement

### Hardware

#### Wi-Fi Adapter Supporting packet injection
- TPLink Adapter

### Software

#### Infrastructure

- VMware
- Virtualbox
- QEMU/KVM
    - Windows 10 VM
    - Kali/Blackarch/ParrotOS VM

#### Assessment

- Maltego - Maltego is an interactive data mining tool that renders directed graphs for link analysis.
- Metasploit Framework - collection of remote exploits and post exploitation tools for all platforms
- SET toolkit - designed to perform advanced attacks against the human element.
- theHarvester - gathering e-mail accounts, user names and hostnames/subdomains from different public sources
- mimikat - extract plain or hash of password.
- dig - bind-utils
- THC Hydra - for brute force
- Powersploit - a collection of Microsoft PowerShell modules
- CrackmapExec - post exploitation tools for Active Directory.
- Burpsuite - can use as proxy as well as active scanner
- Empire - powershell framework for remote and post exploitation.
- Nmap - port scanner
- knockpy - subdomain scanner
- netcat - network utility
- nishang - post exploitation powershell Framework

### Checklist

- [ ] Determination of the type of pentest (Blackbox, Whitebox)
- [ ] Key objectives behind this penetration test
- [ ] Location address and contact (if it is an onsite job)
- [ ] Validation that the Authorization Letter has been signed
- [ ] URL of the web application that is in scope and validation that isaccessible
- [ ]  2 sets of credentials (normal and admin or a privilege user) and validation that are working
- [ ] Determination of the environment (Production or UAT)
- [ ] Number of static and dynamic pages
- [ ] Testing Boundaries (DoS, Brute force attacks etc.)
- [ ] Technologies (PHP, ASP, .NET, IIS, Apache, Operating system etc.)
- [ ] Any VPN or port numbers are needed and verify those ahead of time
- [ ] Any web services that the site may use.
- [ ] Any pages that the client does not want to be tested.
- [ ] Any pages that submit emails
- [ ] IP address of the tester
- [ ] Escalation contact
- [ ] 3rd parties that needs to be contacted in advance of the pentest
- [ ] Web application firewalls and other IDS in place
- [ ] Timeframe of the assessment (dates and hours)
- [ ] Diagrams and any kind of documentation
- [ ] Validation that a backup has been performed recently on theapplication
- [ ] Other client requirements
